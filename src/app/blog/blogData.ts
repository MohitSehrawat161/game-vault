    content: `# How to Choose the Best Gaming Mouse in 2025

With so many options on the market, finding the right gaming mouse can be overwhelming. Here’s what to look for:

## 1. Sensor Type
Optical sensors are generally more accurate, but laser sensors work on more surfaces.

## 2. DPI & Polling Rate
Higher DPI isn’t always better. Choose a DPI that matches your game and play style.

## 3. Ergonomics
Pick a mouse that fits your hand size and grip style (palm, claw, or fingertip).

## 4. Customization
Look for programmable buttons, adjustable weights, and RGB lighting.

## 5. Wired vs Wireless
Modern wireless mice have minimal latency, but wired is still preferred for competitive play.
